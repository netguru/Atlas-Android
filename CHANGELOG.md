  * Fixed last message view cropped when build target was SDK 24.

### Migration Guide

`Participant` and `ParticipantProvider` classes have been removed as `Identity` objects now contain user data.

#### `AtlasAddressBar`
  * No longer need to pass a `ParticipantProvider` on `init()`.
  * `getSelectedParticipants()` now returns a set of `Identity` objects rather than user IDs.
  * `setSelectedParticipants()` now takes a set of `Identity` objects as an argument rather than user IDs.
  * `OnParticipantSelectionChangeListener.onParticipantSelectionChanged()` now passes a list of `Identity` objects rather than user IDs.

#### `AtlasAvatar`
  * No longer need to pass a `ParticipantProvider` on `init()`.
  * `setParticipants(...)` now takes `Identity` objects as arguments rather than user IDs.
  * `getParticipants()` now returns a set of `Identity` objects rather than user IDs.
  * The image URL used is `Identity.getAvatarImageUrl()`

#### `AtlasConversationsRecyclerView`
  * No longer need to pass a `ParticipantProvider` on `init()`.
  * MUST call `onDestroy()` in your Activity's or Fragment's `onDestroy()` to unregister event listeners on `LayerClient`.

#### `AtlasMessageComposer`
  * No longer need to pass a `ParticipantProvider` on `init()`.

#### `AtlasMessagesRecyclerView`
  * No longer need to pass a `ParticipantProvider` on `init()`.
  * MUST call `onDestroy()` in your Activity's or Fragment's `onDestroy()` to unregister event listeners on `LayerClient`.

#### `AtlasTypingIndicator`
  * The method signature of `onTypingIndicator()` has changed. It now passes a full `Identity` object as an argument rather than a user ID.
  * The method signature of `TypingIndicatorFactory.onBindView()` has changed. The map is now keyed by `Identity` objects rather than user IDs. Classes that implement this interface will need to be updated.

#### `AtlasConversationsAdapter`
  * Changes here are only relevant if using this directly without using a `AtlasConversationsRecyclerView`.
  * No longer need to pass a `ParticipantProvider` in the constructors.
  * MUST call `onDestroy()` in your Activity's or Fragment's `onDestroy()` to unregister event listeners on `LayerClient`.

#### `AtlasMessagesAdapter`
  * Changes here are only relevant if using this directly without using a `AtlasMessagesRecyclerView`.
  * No longer need to pass a `ParticipantProvider` in the constructor.
  * MUST call `onDestroy()` in your Activity's or Fragment's `onDestroy()` to unregister event listeners on `LayerClient`.

#### `AtlasCellFactory`
  * Any custom cell factories will need to be updated.
  * No longer need to pass a `ParticipantProvider` on `parseContent()`.
  * No longer need to pass a `ParticipantProvider` on `getParsedContent()`.

#### `MessageSender`
  * No longer need to pass a `ParticipantProvider` on `init()`.
  * Usage of subclasses (`AttachmentSender`, `TextSender`, etc) will need to be updated.

#### `AvatarTypingIndicatorFactory`
  * No longer need to pass a `ParticipantProvider` on `init()`.

#### `Util`
  * No longer need to pass a `ParticipantProvider` on `getConversationTitle()`.
